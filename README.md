# Packet Processing Application

This application consists of a server (`server.js`) and a client (`client.js`). The final output is written to `output.json`.

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v16 or later)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

## Running the Server

1. Start the server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

    The server will start and listen for incoming connections on the specified port.

## Running the Client

1. In a new terminal window, navigate to the project directory.
2. Start the client by running the following command:

    ```bash
    node client.js
    ```

    The client will connect to the server and save the final output to `output.json`.

## Output

The final output of the packet processing is saved in `output.json` in the same directory as the code. This file contains the processed packets in JSON format.
